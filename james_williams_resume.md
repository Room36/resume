James writes and works with code that must be able to input, manage, transform, and report on tens of millions of records without performance issues. Over the past nine years, he has developed skills in: writing efficient SQL Server queries (and tuning existing ones), finding and removing bottlenecks from HTTP web service traffic, and writing fast, correct code.

During his time at Blackbaud, James has led development teams and mentored new developers. He has been involved with transitions from waterfall development methodologies to Scrum and modified agile processes inspired by Marty Cagan. 

He currently leads a team responsible for "back office" operations in the platform, including user-facing ad-hoc querying, basic reporting, and API-level functionality. In addition, James is a member of a "triad" &mdash; consisting of developer lead, a design lead, and a product owner &mdash; where he is instrumental in shepherding new features through a client-discovery process.

* Objective-C
* Cocoa
* Cocoa Touch
* Macintosh user experience design
